## AppProfile.getFieldWells property

Profiles can indicate interactive field wells to display directly in the resource tree. These field wells can be populated by the resources, and will be rendered as a dropdown. Each field well can also dictate an onChange that updates the resource (e.g., sets an input binding).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getFieldWells?: (resource: Res) => FieldWellItem[];
```
