## DataShaperAppProps.appContext property

Apps may supply an arbitrary context object that will be passed down to resources. This provides a seam for injecting app-specific functionality into resources such as async pre-load setup. NOTE: in the future this should be replaced by a dependency injection system.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
appContext?: T;
```
