## Profile type

Resources must have a profile, which is a key defining how it should be interpreted. Profiles are essentially shorthand for a schema URL. The core profiles for DataShaper are defined here, but any application can define one as a string.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export type Profile = KnownProfile
/**
 * Any other custom profile string can be specified by applications.
 */
 | string;
```
