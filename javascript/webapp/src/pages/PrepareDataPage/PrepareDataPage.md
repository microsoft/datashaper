The workflow builder web application allows you to perform lightweight data wrangling by constructing a series of transformation steps.

At the top left of the window is a file open menu allowing you to load CSV table. The dropdown below this will contain of your loaded tables. Selecting one of these tables will display the content in the editor pane below the list.

The displayed table will include buttons to execute transform verbs. The left set operate on a selected column, while the right set operate on multiple columns or tables. When you select a verb, the dialog will populate with the required input controls for the verb to execute. Fill these in and click "Save".

The workflow you build will run immediately whenever you add or edit steps. The latest output will always be displayed. You can review and edit any previous steps by clicking the History link.

You can add as many steps as you need to craft an output table, and any intermediate tables that are created by the steps are available for use by following steps as well.
